# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Purpose

This is a documentation-only repository containing a curated collection of learning resources for AI, Robotics, Agents, and Vibe Coding. There is no source code, build system, or tests.

## Structure

The entire content is in README.md, organized into four main sections:
- **AI (Generic Track)** - Courses, projects, whitepapers, research papers, blogs, books, videos
- **Vibe Coding** - Courses, projects & tools, blogs, videos
- **Agents** - Courses, projects & protocols (ADK, MCP, A2A)
- **Robotics** - Courses

## Contribution Guidelines

When adding new resources:
- Use markdown table format matching existing sections
- Include resource name as a link and a brief description
- For research papers, include authors and date
- For videos, include date
- Place entries in appropriate category sections

## GitHub Guidelines
- Don't add Claude as co-author when commiting on GitHub

## Link validity
- Before commiting, navigate all the existing links to double check if they're still available. If not anymore, remove them
- Before commiting, navigate all new existing links to double check if they're reachable. If not, let me know

## UX
- Before committing, double check the layout of the page with the playwright tool and act as a UX reviewer. If you feel that the page usability is not good, feel free to propose improvement, which I MUST ACCEPT before applying them
